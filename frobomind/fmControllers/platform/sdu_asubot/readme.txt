# topcon_aes25 component
The ASuBot component requires a TopCon AES-25 Electric Steering interface
component named topcon_aes25. Due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with
TopCon the source code and documentation cannot be released to the public.
However if you are able to negotiate a NDA with TopCon and TopCon approves,
then the University of Southern Denmark would be happy to share the AES-25
component.
